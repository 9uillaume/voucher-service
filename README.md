# voucher-service
Service responsible to gather orders and barcodes to prepare voucher printing

Important Note: While coding I like to keep track of my thoughts for the purpose of this assignment, please refer to my [work log](https://github.com/9uillaume/voucher-service/blob/master/WORKLOG.md)!

### To run it

###### Docker

Steps:

- `docker build .` builds image from Dockerfile for the app
- `docker run <built image>` runs Docker image freshly built



###### Locally

Just get Python `3.8` or above, but nothing tricky so should work with many version down and upwards

Get the requirements

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python app.py`



Everything around it such as thoughts, improvements now lives under the work log [here](https://github.com/9uillaume/voucher-service/blob/master/WORKLOG.md).
